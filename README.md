# Kickstarting with Excel
### Overview of the project
I have performed an analysis on a Kickstarter dataset to uncover trends for Louise.
### Purpose
Louise is an up-and-coming playwright who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help her play, Fever, and she's estimating a budget of over $10K. In order to help her make decisions, I had to determine the outcomes of Kickstarter theater campaigns based on the funding goals and their launch dates.

### The Analysis and Challenges Encountered
Excel was used throughout the analysis to organize, sort, and analyze the crowdfunding data in order to determine what factors can make a campaign successful. Throughout the dataset, the funding goals, pledged amounts, and campaign outcomes were the main focus in the analysis to determine the overall campaign results. As I delve further, many excel functions such as filtering, formatting, creating subcategories, and using excel formulas were performed to slice and dice the dataset. Pivot tables, charts, and graphs were used to analyze and then visualize the summary of findings so that it can be presented. The charts and graphs were saved as an image and is linked below in order to visually tell a story. 

I had some challenges trying to figure out the excel formula functions, specifically the COUNTIFS. I had trouble entering the proper equations in the criterias which resulted in incorrect values that flowed through the line chart. Fortunately, I had help with a colleague to explain the COUNTIFS formula so that I can do it on my own. I also stumbled over which filters go on columns and rows in the pivot tables. I mainly overcame these challenges by trouble shooting what caused the errors and trying again to get to the same results in the module. Google was also my main source of independent help, as well as going back to the hints and links to internet help from within the module exercises. Overall, I feel comfortable in Excel but I do need more practice and understanding of formula equations, pivot tables, and any excel shortcuts to perform the tasks.

### Results and Conclusions
Based on the outcomes by launch dates:
* The most successful theater campaigns were started in May
    - December in particular is the worst time to launch a campaign

Based on the outcomes on goals:
* More than half of the overall campaigns for plays were successful based on funding goals
    - Funding goals of less than $5,000 as well as between $35K-45K were the most successful
    - Funding goals of more than $50K had a higher chance of failing

According to these assumptions, Louise can plan her campaign by mirroring other successful ones in the same theater category.

### Limitations and Recommendations
The line graph showing the outcomes based on funding goals does not properly compare the data between the successful and failed campaigns. I would have recommended to use either a bar graph or column charts so that you can clearly see a side-by-side comparison of how many campaigns succeeded versus failed ones. This way it would have been easier to determine a success and failure percentage rates based on a given funding goal. Using a bar graph or a column chart, I would also show the percentage value on the top of each bar/column to allow for a more in-depth and accurate interpretation of the data. Lastly, I would have recommended to shorten the range in the dataset to hone in and get a more specific range according to Louise's estimated budget of over $10K. Based on an estimated budget of over $10K, perhaps the range should be between $5K to $15/20K then have it broken out in every $2K incremental value. This would likely change the success and failure rates to give a more relevant and close to accurate assumptions for Louise.
