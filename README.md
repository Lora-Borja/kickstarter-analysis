# Kickstarting with Excel
### Overview of the project
I have performed an analysis on a Kickstarter dataset to uncover trends for Louise.
### Purpose
Louise is an up-and-coming playwright who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help her play, Fever, and she's estimating a budget of over $10K. In order to help her make decisions, I had to determine the outcomes of Kickstarter theater campaigns based on the funding goals and their launch dates.

### The Analysis and Challenges Encountered
Excel was used throughout the analysis to organize, sort, and analayze the crowdfunding data in order to determine what factors can make a campaign successful. Throughout the dataset, the funding goals, pledged amounts, and campaign outcomes were the main focus in the analysis to determine the overall campaign results. As I delve further, many excel functions such as filtering, formatting, creating subcategories, and using excel formulas were performed to slice and dice the dataset. Pivot tables, charts, and graphs were used to analyze and then visualize the summary of findings so that it can be presented to tell a story.

### Results
* The most successful theater campaigns were started in May
    - December in particular is the worst time to launch a campaign
* More than half of the overall campaigns for plays were successful based on funding goals
    - Funding goals of less than $5,000 as well as between $35K-45K we the most successful
    - Funding goals of more than $50K had a higher chance of failing

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
*What are some limitations of this dataset?
*What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
