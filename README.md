### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
## Results
* The most successful theater campaigns were started in May
    - December in particular is the worst time to launch a campaign
* More than half of the overall campaigns for plays were successful based on funding goals
    - Funding goals of less than $5,000 as well as between $35K-45K we the most successful
    - Funding goals of more than $50K had a higher chance of failing

*What are some limitations of this dataset?
*What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
