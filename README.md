# Kickstarting with Excel
### Overview of the project
I have performed an analysis on a Kickstarter dataset to uncover trends for Louise.
### Purpose
Louise is an up-and-coming playwright who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help her play, Fever, and she's estimating a budget of over $10K. In order to help her make decisions, I had to determine the outcomes of Kickstarter theater campaigns based on the funding goals and their launch dates.

### Results
* The most successful theater campaigns were started in May
    - December in particular is the worst time to launch a campaign
* More than half of the overall campaigns for plays were successful based on funding goals
    - Funding goals of less than $5,000 as well as between $35K-45K we the most successful
    - Funding goals of more than $50K had a higher chance of failing

### Analysis and Challenges
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
*What are some limitations of this dataset?
*What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
